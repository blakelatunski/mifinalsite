        <b>Classic Game Project</b>
        <p>For this project, I worked with one other group member to recreate a game from the 8-bit era. Our main focus was getting the 
            core mechanics of the game feeling as authentic as possible. The creation of Donkey Kong was code intensive and most of our time 
            making this game went into scripting and animations. This project and the custom game project were the biggest tasks I have taken on so far. 
            I learned a lot about different ways to code games and what I learned on this game will be beneficial to me as I continue my journey in game design.</p> <br>

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <b>Custom Game Project</b>
        <p>For my final exam in MI 231, I was tasked with creating a game from scratch. The option was given to work in a pair and I took this opportunity to 
            build upon my time management and communications skills within a team. My team also utilized a burn down chart to organize each task and assign each 
            piece of the game to a particular person. This allowed us to see how much progress we had made on the game and how far we still needed to go to complete 
            our game before the deadline.</p> <br>

        <b>Brickout</b>
        <p>This project was created as part of an in-class prototype based on the game Brickout. While creating this game, I attempted to add 
            something to the original game with a new scoring system and art from the Unity Asset Store. The game was simple to create overall and 
            shows that even an easy game to code can be enjoyable to both create and play. </p> <br>
